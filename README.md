# hey, i’m tadisa.

i’m an 19 y/o computer science student and aspiring software dev. currently learning how to turn ideas into actual projects — and doing my best not to overthink the process.
i like building things that make life easier, prettier, or just more fun. i’m self-teaching, experimenting, and slowly regaining my confidence with code after a few chaotic learning curves.

### what i’m up to:
- brushing up on python (automation & scripting)
- relearning html, css, and javascript (we're calling it a “redemption arc”)
- figuring out flutter + firebase for a personal app ideas
- trying to land freelance work on the side

### what i care about:
- clean, functional design
- building a solid portfolio
- making tech feel less intimidating for people like me

>still figuring things out — but at least this time, i’m shipping it.
